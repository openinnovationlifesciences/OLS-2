# OLS-2_Open-Innovation-in-Life-Sciences

Welcome to the Open Innovation in Life Sciences (OILS) Association! Thanks for dropping by!

Open science (OS) accelerates research outcomes and reduces effort redundancy. OILS wants to build an open research ecosystem in Swiss life sciences. We work with early career researchers (ECRs) to help them understand what OS is and how they can use OS tools in their every day research routine.

## Description

Open science is the practice of science where data, lab notes, publications, etc. are made publicly available to enable reuse, redistribution, and reproducibility of all parts of the research process. Such practices encourage collaborations and make science more efficient. Open is the way of doing science for the leaders of tomorrow.

We at the OILS association help life scientists understand what open science is to them and, most importantly, how to practice open science as part of their research routines via **public discussions, workshops, courses, and our annual Open Innovation in Life Sciences conference.** Everything we do is motivated by early career life scientists and supported by leaders in open science. We are always looking for more members to join our open science community!





Use the information you gathered in the Open Canvas exercise as a starting point. Be sure to:

Explain what makes your project special, useful, exciting! You can use the ideas you generated for “Unique Value Proposition” in your Open Canvas here.
Show how to get started using or contributing to the project. If you’re just getting started, this could be as simple as asking people to attend a planning call or kick-off event, or sign up for an email newsletter about the project. If you’re not sure quite how to get users involved just yet, don’t worry! In the next module, you’ll devise some ways for newcomers to get involved, and create contributor guidelines. Once you’ve done the next module, you can come back to this README and add a link to contributor guidelines to this section.
State what resources are most needed. If you have a need for a special kind of help, expertise, or a resource like event space, be sure to mention that here.
